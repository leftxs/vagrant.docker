#Vim

The default editor is [vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim's Hompeage"). Vim is configured with a couple of plugins like syntax checking for Dockerfiles and git integration.

## Vim Plugins

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim "Vundle's Homepage") is used for managing the plugins.

Following plugins are installed:
- [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive "fugitive plugin"): Git wrapper
- [Dockerfile.vim](https://github.com/ekalinin/Dockerfile.vim "dockerfile plugin"): Vim syntax file for [Docker](http://docker.io/)'s [Dockerfile](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/builder/)
