# About this documentation

We use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org "MkDocs's Homepage") to write Documentation.

From their website:

*MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.*
