# Motivation

Why not just use [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/ "Page of boot2docker") or [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/ "CoreOS's Homepage") ?

There is **nothing** wrong with them ! It is quite possible that we will move to one of them in the future.

These two are more meant to be for hosting, our idea is more for developing on containers, which is if course also possible with boot2docker or CoreOS.
