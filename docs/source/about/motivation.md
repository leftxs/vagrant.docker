# Motivation

Why not just use [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/ "Page of boot2docker") or [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/ "CoreOS's Homepage") ?

There is **nothing** wrong with them, booth are awesome !

So why we started *vagrant.docker* then ?

The difference is that *vagrant.docker* is more focusing on a **whole
development environment** and running **everything** in the virtual machine.

Besides docker *vagrant.docker* comes also with development tools like vim and git already installed.

We try to give them some useful default settings like a awesome vim configuration focused on docker and documentation, a useful bash configuration and more.

*vagrant.docker* is pretty much wip [work in progress] and under development, there will be a lot of changes in the future, like moving to a own custom image [small, fast and easy to add more features], get rid of Ansible and much more.

More to be come ........
